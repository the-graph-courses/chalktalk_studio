## Introduction

::: {.fragment tts="Welcome to the presentation on uses of math models in public health. These models are essential for understanding and improving population health."}
Math models help us understand disease spread, predict outcomes, and support decision-making.
:::

::: {.fragment tts="They provide insights by simulating scenarios and evaluating interventions in real time."}
They are used for forecasting trends, assessing interventions, and planning resource allocation.
:::

## Epidemic Modeling

::: {.fragment tts="Epidemic modeling is one of the core applications in public health. Models such as the SIR model simulate how diseases spread."}
Epidemic models break down populations into susceptible, infected, and recovered groups.
:::

::: {.fragment tts="These models are critical for predicting outbreak peaks and informing public health strategies."}
They help design strategies for quarantine, social distancing, and vaccination.
:::

## Resource Allocation

::: {.fragment tts="Math models assist in optimizing the allocation of limited medical resources like beds, vaccines, and manpower."}
They guide decision making on how to best distribute scarce resources.
:::

::: {.fragment tts="Let's look at a simple code snippet that models resource allocation using Python."}
```{python}
def allocate_resources(total_resources, population_needs):
    allocation = {}
    for area, need in population_needs.items():
        allocation[area] = total_resources * (need / sum(population_needs.values()))
    return allocation

# Example usage:
resources = 1000
needs = {"Area1": 350, "Area2": 450, "Area3": 200}
print(allocate_resources(resources, needs))
```
:::

## Policy Simulation

::: {.fragment tts="Policy simulation using math models allows public health officials to test intervention strategies before implementing them."}
Simulate potential outcomes of policies like lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccination drives.
:::

::: {.fragment tts="These simulations help in visualizing the impact of different strategies and making data-driven decisions."}
They can forecast how different policies may curb the spread and reduce mortality.
:::

## Conclusion

::: {.fragment tts="In conclusion, math models are indispensable tools in public health."}
They support epidemic forecasting, optimal resource allocation, and policy evaluation.
:::

::: {.fragment tts="By leveraging these models, public health officials can make informed decisions that ultimately save lives."}
Thank you for exploring the uses of math models in public health.
