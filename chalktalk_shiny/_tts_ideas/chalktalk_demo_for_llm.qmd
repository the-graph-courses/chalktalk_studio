## Welcome

::: {.fragment ttv="Welcome to this guide on using ChalkTalk. As you can see, ChalkTalk allows you to convert text to engaging presentations, with audio, animated slides, and video avatars."}

## Using Fragments and TTS

::: {.fragment tts="The speech text can be different from the displayed text!"}
Text â‰  Speech
:::


## Fragment Examples

::: {.fragment tts="You can use fragments with different types of content"}
You can use fragments with:
:::

::: {.fragment tts="Regular text and paragraphs"}
- Regular text
:::

::: {.fragment tts="Code blocks and examples. This is kind of our target use case at the moment."}
- Code blocks and examples
:::

::: {.fragment tts="And you can add images, like this one of a cat"}
- Images

## Code Example

::: {.fragment tts="Here, we add text to speech to a code block. The Python code below defines a dictionary with a key-value pair. You need to set echo to true to show the code."}

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```
:::

::: {.fragment tts="We can access the value associated with the key `age`. Note that the code can actually be executed when you render the slide."}
```{python}
#| echo: true
my_dict["age"]
```
:::

## R Example

::: {.fragment tts="You can also use R code blocks. Here's an example of a simple R code."}

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
```
:::


## Pseudocode Example

::: {.fragment tts="When using pseudocode or code that shouldn't be executed, it's important to set eval to false to prevent ChalkTalk from trying to run the code."}

For pseudocode, use `#| eval: false`:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
function bubble_sort(array):
    for i in range(length of array):
        for j in range(0 to length-i-1):
            if array[j] > array[j+1]:
                swap array[j] and array[j+1]
    return array
```
:::

## Math Example

::: {.fragment tts="You can even add text to speech to mathematical equations. For example, here's the quadratic formula. Do you remember how to use it?"}

The quadratic formula:
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

## Some other Rules

- Avoid using special characters in the title
- When you provide speech, there should always be some corresponding content fragment to show.
- Whenever there is some code which might produce output, only have one such element per slide, since otherwise the content will overflow. Move to the next slide for future code outputs. A slide is indicated by the `##` header.
- Avoid using single ` ` to indicate code, as this conflicts with the slide syntax.
- Avoid long chunks of text. Split into multiple fragments.
